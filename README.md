# SolidNG.movr

A realistic open world game, running entirely
in your browser. No build step, no installs — just Three.js from a CDN and
plain JavaScript ES modules. Steal cars, fly helicopters, rob stores, fight a
gang for territory, outrun tanks at five stars... or ignore all of it and
web-swing between the towers at 200 km/h.

Ten "seasons" of updates have piled onto the original open world: zombie
outbreaks, a kaiju that rises from the harbor, train heists, a mayor's
office, an empire of owned properties, a casino heist, a subway, a
nightclub, a chess hustler, ghosts, a boss-rush gauntlet, and dozens more
side systems described below. The code is plain ES modules — one file per
system, ~140 of them, all wired into `js/main.js`.

## Run it

Any static file server works. The easiest:

```
npm start
```

(or `npx -y http-server -p 8080 -c-1 .`)

Then open **http://localhost:8080** and click PLAY.

## Features

### Spider-Man traversal
- **Web swinging** — physical pendulum on buildings; anchors picked high and
  ahead so swinging down a street just works. Swing pump builds speed, the
  rope auto-winches clear of the asphalt, releases slingshot you into a
  floaty glide with seconds of hang-time to chain the next web.
- **Zip-to-point**, **wall-running**, rooftop landing with a forgiving
  superhero roll, and a **style meter**: mid-air catches, fast releases,
  wall-runs and zips earn points that cash out as money when you land.
- **Web attack (Q)** pins pedestrians, gangsters, traffic — even cop cars.

### The city
- Procedurally generated 64-block dusk city: towers with glowing windows,
  neon billboards, rooftop clutter, parks, helipads, street lamps.
- **Day/night cycle** (1 real minute = 1 game hour): the sun sets, windows
  light up, headlights come on, street lamps glow.
- **Weather**: rolling rain storms with lightning that dim the sky.
- Living streets: 70 pedestrians who flee gunfire, AI traffic that brakes,
  **pigeon flocks** that scatter, **rush-hour and night traffic density**,
  fewer people out after dark.

### Crime & economy
- **Rob the corner stores** (green rings, hold E) — cash plus 2-star heat.
- **The bank job**: crack the City Bank vault (hold E), hold the lobby
  against guards while the drill runs, then escape a 4-star manhunt to the
  safehouse beam. Once per in-game day, $3000.
- **The armored truck**: a 400 HP cash transporter runs routes every few
  minutes (gold square on the minimap). Wreck it for $1000 plus a ring of
  spilled cash cubes — and the heat that comes with it.
- **Vigilante**: steal a police cruiser mid-patrol, press **V**, and chase
  down fleeing criminals. Every takedown chains a tougher, faster target;
  payouts escalate and your best streak is saved.
- **The Lucky 7 casino**: blackjack (hit/stand/double, 3:2 blackjack), a
  slot machine (7-7-7 jackpot pays 25×) and European roulette (red/black,
  dozens, or a 36× lucky number) — walk in with E, hop between the games
  at the table.
- **Property raids**: own real estate and crooks will come for it — a crew
  hits your casino/stadium/Spire every few minutes. Wipe them out for cash
  and rep, or the place gets ransacked and pays no income for the day.
- **Gang territory**: the Vipers hold the north-east district and shoot on
  sight. Put ten of them down to seize the turf — then defend it when the
  **Jackals raid** in periodic turf wars, or lose the district again.
- **REX the dog**: adopt him at the kennel near spawn ($500). He follows
  you across the city, fetches money pickups, and barks when cops close in.
- **Odd jobs & toys everywhere**: ambulance rescues, harbor vehicle exports,
  bounty contracts with bodyguards, a bare-knuckle **fight club** on the
  waterfront after dark, a lottery kiosk, **five-card poker** at the casino,
  a **jetpack** shop, BASE-jump ring trials off the Spire, ten golden sky
  hoops — and strange lights over the Spire past midnight.
- **The WEB DEN** near spawn sells permanent upgrades: longer webs, faster
  winch, body armor (150 HP).
- Money & health pickups, ammo crates, and a style meter that pays for flair.

### Wanted system
- 5 stars of escalation: police cruisers ram and corner you, the **police
  helicopter** with a door gunner arrives at 3 stars, and at **5 stars the
  army sends a tank** — 600 HP, live cannon... and stealable. Left-click
  fires shells while you drive it.

### Vehicles
- Steal any car — arcade physics, handbrake drifts with **skid marks** and
  tyre smoke, speed-sensitive FOV.
- **Motorbikes** (every 4th parked vehicle): fast, nimble, lean into corners.
- Helicopters on the park helipads. Space to climb — it always wins over a
  held sprint key.
- **Boats & jet-skis** at the harbor past the east edge — plus two boat
  races (Harbor Circuit and Buoy Slalom).
- **Car radio**: five procedural WebAudio stations (lofi, synthwave, bass,
  desi, night jazz).

### Missions — ten types in rotation
Walk into the yellow beam: **Delivery**, **Street race**, **Swing race**
(floating sky rings, webs only), **Taxi shift**, **Hit contract**,
**Boss chopper**, **Firefighter**, **Rooftop hit**, **Witness escort**, and
a **rival web-slinger** duel. Rewards scale as you complete more — plus
free-roam races, the stadium arena, the bank heist, vigilante chases and
turf wars outside the mission beam.

### Beyond the basics (Seasons 2–10)
Ten waves of updates layered a second game's worth of systems on top of the
core loop above. A sample of what's actually in `js/`, all reachable in a
normal playthrough:
- **Boss fights & events**: a rival **nemesis** web-slinger, a **kaiju** that
  wades out of the harbor on stormy nights, a **zombie outbreak** after dark,
  a **war-mech boss rush**, and city-wide **disasters** (forced via cheat or
  random).
- **Heists & crime careers**: a **train heist**, a **casino heist**, a
  **jewelry store job**, a **drug lab raid**, a **black-market arms dealer**,
  a **repo man** side gig, and an undercover **cop career** you can take
  instead of a life of crime (complete with **prison** intake if you get
  caught).
- **City institutions**: a **mayor's office** and city **empire** (buy up
  properties for passive income), a **stock market**, a **museum** heist, a
  **nightclub**, a **subway/metro**, a **crew** you can recruit, a
  **syndicate** campaign, and a rotating **calendar** of city events.
- **Odd jobs**: **taxi driving**, **pizza delivery**, **valet parking**,
  **car wash**, **barber shop**, **ferry** routes, **ice cream truck**,
  **news helicopter** ride-alongs, **storm chasing**, **busking** for tips,
  a gun **workbench**, **fishing**, a **gym**, a **fortune teller**, **dice**
  games, and a **hobo** you can hand money to.
- **Traversal toys**: **wingsuit**, **skydiving**, **base jumping**,
  **ziplines**, a hot-air **balloon**, a **drone**, a **skateboard** and
  **trick park**, a **derby** (demolition-style), and street **elevators**.
- **World detail**: **ATMs**, **payphones** (with side jobs), **graffiti**
  tagging, **fire hydrants**, **speed cameras**, parking **meters**, **NPC
  emotes**, **wildlife**, **ghosts** at night, and vehicle **damage/tuning
  effects**.
- **Meta systems**: **prestige** (reset for permanent perks), **perks**,
  **bribes** and a **lawyer** to clear your wanted level, a **pink slip**
  (car-ownership) racing mode, a **most wanted** board, a **bounty** system,
  a **bodyguard** you can hire, **tournament** and **poker tournament**
  brackets, an **explorer** log, and **cheat codes** (see the pause menu).

This list still isn't exhaustive — check `js/` for the full set of ~140
feature modules, each one self-contained and imported into `js/main.js`.

### Progression
- **XP levels** unlock skills: double-jump (2), web-dash (4), slow-motion
  airborne aim (6), parkour sprint (8).
- **Wardrobe suits** with perks: Classic (+50% style), Symbiote (2x melee,
  10s webs), Stealth (heat fades twice as fast).
- **Lifetime stats and 10 achievements**, all in the pause menu.

### Tech
- **Playable on phones**: virtual joystick + buttons, and it's a **PWA** —
  add to home screen, runs full-screen, works offline after the first load.
- Pause menu with volume / sensitivity / invert-Y / low-graphics settings,
  **photo mode** with filters, full-screen map with waypoints, chase music
  that swells with the wanted level, NPC speech bubbles, intro flyover.
- Procedural WebAudio everything — guns, explosions, engines, sirens, rotor
  thump, thunder, mission stingers, radio. Zero audio files.
- Post-processing bloom, ACES tone mapping, PMREM reflections.
- Autosave to localStorage: money, missions, ammo, upgrades, territory.
- WASTED / BUSTED screens, HUD with minimap (cops, choppers, stores, gang
  turf, tanks), live WASD key indicator.

## Tech stack
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** r170, loaded straight from a CDN via
  an `importmap` in `index.html` — no bundler, no `node_modules` for the
  game itself.
- Plain **JavaScript ES modules**, one file per system, imported directly by
  the browser.
- **Procedural WebAudio** for every sound effect and the car radio — no
  audio files ship with the game.
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** (`playwright-core`) is the one
  `devDependency`, used only by the scripts in `test/` to drive the game
  headlessly and assert features work; it isn't needed to play.
